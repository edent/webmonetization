An ASE is an entity that provides and maintains payment accounts for payers and payees. ASEs that maintain financial accounts are regulated entities within the countries they operate. Examples include digital wallet providers, banks, crypto wallets, and mobile money providers.

To make the documentation easier to follow, we use the terms *wallet provider* and *digital wallet provider* to represent any ASE that has implemented Open Payments.
