A wallet address is a secure, unique URL that represents an Open Payments-enabled account. Each wallet address provides an entry point to the Open Payments APIs, allowing the site visitor’s software to get the details it needs to set up a payment.

Similar to how an email address is a publicly shareable ID for an email account, a wallet address is a publicly shareable payment address for the underlying account. Knowing someone’s wallet address in no way allows unauthorized access to, or payments from, the account itself.
