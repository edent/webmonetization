What does Web Monetization NOT do/what is it unable to do on its own?
* Execute payments/settle payments; apply exchange rates and fees
* Allow recipients to specify payment details, such as how much they want to receive before unlocking exclusive content.


The site visitor retains control over which sites they pay and how much they spend.

* It allows you to send micropayments. The ability to transact in micropayments must first and foremost be supported/allowed by the wallet provider. The minimum amount then allowed by the WM extension is dependent upon what the user is allowed to enter in the UI. "The spec does not establish specific limits for micro transactions, allowing them to be as small as fractions of a cent. The limits are set though by the financial entity issuing the wallet and the preferences of the user."
* Payments can be made without any user interaction. Not completely false; however, there is some initial setup, if the user so chooses. A number of the comments we’ve read illustrate how uncomfortable people are with the idea of the browser making payments without their permission/knowledge, which is not how it’s supposed to work.
* Users aren’t redirected to a payment gateway website. If WM payments work over Open Payments, and Open Payments uses GNAP to initiate an outgoing payment, then is this redirect statement true?
* Users are expected to save their credit card/payment details in their browser/in the extension.




What are some concerns with WM?
* Security/malicious actors/hijacks
* "There are also no specific requirements for a wallet other than being compliant with the Open Payments API. This means that anyone on the web can implement a wallet as long as they can build the wallet's financial ecosystem or integrate into an existing one."
* The premise that we need to pay for things is flawed; conversely, people don’t understand how free content isn’t really free
* That it’s just another way to monetize content on top of, not in place of, other ways
* Since creators can’t define a price, they can continuously check on active payments and programmatically unlock once X amount is received (just ask for a subscription at this point)
