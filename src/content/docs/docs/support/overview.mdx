Web Monetization allows you to support the content and creators you enjoy while retaining complete control over who, if, when, and how much to pay. Web Monetization (WM) also preserves your privacy by not collecting or tracking personally identifiable information and browsing history.

## Benefits

#### Sign up with the Web Monetization-compatible digital wallet provider of your choice.

Other solutions may require you to sign up for a particular application, platform, or service provider to support your favorite content. WM doesn’t have this limitation. As long as your chosen wallet provider is compatible with WM, you can send payments to any web monetized pages. 

#### Control whether, when, and how much to pay. 

One key differentiator of WM is that you retain control over if, when, and how much to pay. WM does not allow web monetized sites to define the amount you must pay, nor does it allow sites to pull payments from your account. All payments and their amounts must be explicitly authorized or pre-authorized by you.

#### Send payments in your preferred currency.

WM allows you to send a payment in your preferred currency while the recipient can receive the payment in a currency of their choosing. 

#### Send payments privately. 

WM is designed to preserve your privacy. While a recipient can determine how much you sent (and how much they’ve received), WM does not provide the recipient with personally identifiable information such as your name, wallet address, IP address, or anything else that the recipient could use to correlate you with a payment.

#### Send payments without entering your billing information on each site and without saving billing details in your browser.

When you set up your WM configuration software, you link the software to your wallet. That link is all you need to pay web monetized pages. There's no per-site payment forms to complete, and neither the WM software nor your browser need to save payment details. Your details are stored by your wallet provider only.

## Constraints

#### You may not be able to send Web Monetization payments in your region.

To send WM payments, you must have an account with a WM-compatible digital wallet provider. 

Digital wallet providers are regulated entities within the countries they operate. This means there are certain rules, regulations, and laws they must follow in order to provide payment accounts and support transactions to and from these accounts. Since obtaining the proper licensing and registration can be a time consuming and complex process, it's possible that a compatible wallet provider is not yet available in your area.

#### Web Monetization is not an ad blocker.

Sending a payment to a web monetized site does not guarantee an ad-free experience. A website owner can choose to hide ads in response to a payment, but the decision is entirely up to them. The purpose of WM is to facilitate payments from sender to receiver. If and how a website responds to a payment is beyond the scope of WM.
