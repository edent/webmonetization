## Prerequisites






## Receiving payments

To web monetize a site, you must add a Monetization [`<link>`](/docs/implement/link) element to each page. The destination of the link (the `href`) must point to the wallet address assigned to you by your wallet provider. The underlying payment account is the account into which your payments are received.

:::note[Underlying payment account]
Your underlying payment account supports sending and receiving. If you're both a supporter and publisher of web monetized content, you can use the same wallet address in your <mark>extension/About page</mark> that you use in the Monetization `<link>` element on your website.
