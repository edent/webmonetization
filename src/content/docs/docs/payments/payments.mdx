1. Alice signs up with a WM-compatible digital wallet provider so she can receive WM payments in USD. Her wallet provider assigns her a wallet address of `https://wallet.example.com/alice`.
2. Alice adds the monetization `<link>` element to her page, adding her wallet address as the `href` value. Alice can now receive WM payments!
```html
<html>
    <head>
        <title>My page</title>
        <link rel="monetization" href="https://wallet.example.com/alice">
    </head>
    <body>...</body>
</html>
```
3. Bob signs up with a WM-compatible digital wallet provider so he can send WM payments in GBP. His wallet provider assigns him a wallet address of `https://anotherwallet.example/bob`.
4. Bob installs the Interledger WM extension into his browser.
5. Bob connects the extension to his digital wallet and configures his payment preferences in the extension. 
6. <mark>Something about Bob giving extension/wallet authorization to make payments</mark>.
7. Bob visits Alice's page. 
8. Bob's extension detects the monetization link on Alice's page.
9. Bob's extension issues a GET request to Alice's wallet address to discover the Open Payments service endpoint.
```
GET /alice HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/json
Host: wallet.example.com
```
10. The response includes, among other details, the URL for Alice's grant request endpoint AKA authorization server.
```
HTTP/1.1 200 Success
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "id":"https://wallet.example/alice",
  "assetCode":"USD",
  "assetScale":2,
  "authServer":"https://wallet.example/auth"
}
```
