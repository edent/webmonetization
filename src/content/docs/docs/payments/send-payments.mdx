## Prerequisites



## Sending payments

You must either install a <mark>[Web Monetization extension](/docs/support/get-started/) or configure [Chromium's About page](/docs/support/get-started/)</mark> to send WM payments. In either case, you're required to enter the wallet address assigned to you by your wallet provider. The underlying payment account is the account from which your payments are sent.
