title: Web Monetization API
---








Most web browsers come with a standard set of built-in APIs. One such API is the Console API, which “provides functionality to allow developers to perform debugging tasks”. As a standard browser API, developers can expect the Console API to be available in all major web browsers and without needing to install one or more extensions. 

The Web Monetization API is a browser API that has not yet been accepted as a standard. This means a Web Monetization extension is required to use the API as the major web browsers don’t yet include it in their builds. 

The Web Monetization API is responsible for:
1. Recognizing when an HTML document/page/site contains one or more Monetization `<link>` elements
2. Extracting the wallet address defined within each `<link>` element
3. <mark>Issuing a request to the wallet address to obtain authorization and instructions for sending a payment</mark>
4. <mark>Communicating the information to the site visitor’s wallet</mark>

The API does **not** allow the HTML document/page/site to:
* Initiate payments
* Define the amount it wants to receive

The site visitor retains control over which sites they pay and how much they spend.
