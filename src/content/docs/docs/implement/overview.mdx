Implementing Web Monetization only requires two steps. First, obtain a wallet address from a digital wallet provider that supports Web Monetization payments. Second, add the wallet address to your site using the Monetization `<link>` element. That’s it.

What does Web Monetization give creators?
* A new/additional revenue model
* Passive income
* No app store, platform, or service provider fees (however, there may be wallet provider fees)
* The ability to accept payments in their preferred currency, regardless of their supporter’s currency
* No platform lock-in


What does Web Monetization give web developers?
* At its most basic, it’s an easy-to-implement solution, only one line of HTML
* No need to develop/maintain frontend or backend UIs/services, such as prompts for payments from visitors, CMS for subscriptions, payment forms, etc.
