## Prerequisites

To web monetize an HTML document, such as a web page:
* You must have a valid [wallet address](/docs/wallet-address/wallets)
* The document must be secure and served over HTTPS
* The document must contain one or more monetization `<link>` elements

## Monetization `<link>` element

The monetization `<link>` element provides the signal that indicates your HTML document supports Web Monetization.

### Syntax

```html
<link rel="monetization" href="https://(walletaddress)">
```

* The `rel` attribute is always `monetization`
* The `href` attribute equals your wallet address

For example:

```html
<link rel="monetization" href="https://wallet.example.com/alice">
```

:::note
The `href` attribute only supports a wallet address in URL format. If your wallet address begins with `$`, visit <LinkOut href='https://paymentpointers.org/'>paymentpointers.org</LinkOut> and enter your address into the _Payment Pointer_ field. Use the address that appears in the adjacent _URL_ field as your `href` value.
:::

### Placement

A monetization `<link>` is `body-ok`, meaning it's allowed in your document's `<head>` and/or `<body>`.

### Multiple monetization links

A single HTML document can contain multiple monetization `<link>` elements; however, your site visitor's WM configuration software determines how to handle this scenario. One visitor's software could split payments evenly between all links while another only sends payments to the first link it finds. 

:::tip[Recommendation]
The Interledger WM extension splits payments evenly between all links. We recommend other software developers follow this approach.

### Monetizing media 

The following elements can be web monetized by adding the monetization `<link>` element between the open and close tags.

* `<video>`
* `<audio>`
* `<picture>`

For example:

```html
<audio src="music.mp3">
    <link rel=”monetization” href=”https://wallet.example.com/bob”>
</audio>
```

## How it works

### HTML DOM API

Due to the efforts of the <LinkOut href="https://www.w3.org/">W3C</LinkOut>, there are a number of APIs that all major browser vendors build into their browsers. One such API is the <LinkOut href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_DOM_API">HTML DOM API</LinkOut>, which defines the functionality of HTML elements.

#### HTMLLinkElement

The HTML DOM API's `HTMLLinkElement` interface defines how the `<link>` element functions. The `<link>` element is what allows you to link your HTML document to a resource. 

The two most recognizable `HTMLLinkElement` properties are `href` and `rel`. The `href` property defines the URL to the resource. The `rel` property indicates the type of link, or relationship, the resource has to the current document.

### Link type rel="monetization"

Browsers already know how to interpret certain link types because of web standards. One standard link type is `stylesheet`. When a browser loads a page that contains `<link href=”styles.css” rel=”stylesheet”>`, the browser automatically knows to import a style sheet from the given URL.

Unlike `stylesheet`, the `monetization` link type is not a standard. Major web browsers don't automatically know what to do when one or more monetization links are placed in an HTML document. Until `monetization` becomes a standard, browsers must rely on a Web Monetization agent.

### Web Monetization agent

Some of the responsibilities of a Web Monetization agent include:

* Extending the HTML DOM API so that `monetization` is a valid link type
* Processing the monetization link or links within an HTML document
* Instrumenting payments by calling the Open Payments API

Until the WM agent is natively included in web browsers, the agent must be added to browsers some other way. One way is to install an extension that includes the agent, such as the Interledger Foundation's WM extension.

#### Sequence

<Steps>
1. Your site visitor installs Web Monetization configuration software, such as the ILF's browser extension, then visits your page.
2. The visitor's WM agent, which is built into their WM configuration software, recognizes the monetization `<link>` element in your page and parses it to get your wallet address (the `href` value).
3. Their agent communicates with both your and their [account servicing entity (ASE)](/docs/resources/glossary#account-servicing-entity-ase), via the Open Payments APIs, to set up the payment.
4. Their ASE initiates the outgoing payment to your ASE.
