title: Monetization <Link> Element
---

import { LinkOut } from "@interledger/docs-design-system";

Web Monetization extends the capabilities of the standard HTML `<link>` element so that the element supports `rel="monetization"`.

Two components are required to web monetize a site:
* A valid [wallet address](/docs/wallet/wallets)
* The Monetization `<link>` element on each page you want to monetize

## Monetization `<link>`

### Syntax

```html
<link rel="monetization" href="https://(walletaddress)">
```

* The `rel` attribute is always `monetization`.
* The `href` attribute equals your wallet address.

For example:

```html
<link rel="monetization" href="https://wallet.example.com/alice">
```

:::note
The `href` attribute only supports wallet addresses in URL format. If you were assigned a wallet address that starts with `$`, replace it with `https://`. For example, `$wallet.example.com/alice` becomes `https://wallet.example.com/alice`. 
:::

### How it works

The `rel` attribute defines the relationship between a linked resource (your wallet address) and the current document. 

Since the `monetization` link type isn't a <LinkOut href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/dev/links.html#linkTypes">standard</LinkOut>, web browsers don't automatically know how to interpret it. This means your site visitors must either: 

* Use a web browser that has the ability to interpret it built in
* Install an extension that can interpret it

## Link placement

The `monetization` link type is `body-ok`, meaning the Monetization `<link>` element is allowed in the `<head>` and/or `<body>`.

## Multiple links

A single page can contain multiple Monetization `<link>` elements; however, it’s up to the visitor’s <mark>Web Monetization provider</mark> to decide how to split up payments. The Interledger WM extension splits the payment, <mark>regardless of it being a tip or a stream</mark>, equally between all wallet addresses on a page.

## Monetizing media 

The following elements can be web monetized by adding the Monetization `<link>` element between the open and close tags.

* `<video>`
* `<audio>`
* `<picture>`

For example:

```html
<audio src=”music.mp3>
    <link rel=”monetization” href=”https://wallet.example.com/bob”>
</audio>
```

<p><mark>If the site visitor is streaming a payment, then… (does the media element have to be active/playing?)</mark></p>

<p><mark>If the site visitor tips, then… (will the wallet defined for media receive a tip if it's not active/playing?)</mark></p>
