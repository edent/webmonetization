To web monetize an HTML document, such as a web page:
* You must have a valid [wallet address](/docs/wallet/wallets)
* The document must be secure and served over HTTPS
* The document must contain one or more monetization `<link>` elements

## Browser APIs

Thanks to the efforts of the W3C, there are a number of APIs that all major browser vendors build into their browsers. One such API is the HTML DOM API.

## HTML DOM API

The <LinkOut href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_DOM_API">HTML DOM API</LinkOut> is a browser API composed of interfaces that define the functionality of HTML elements. 

One commonly known interface, `HTMLLinkElement`, defines how the `<link>` element works. The `<link>` element is what allows you to link your page to a resource, such as a style sheet or a different page.

### HTMLLinkElement properties

Of the properties described within the `HTMLLinkElement` IDL, the two most recognizable are `href` and `rel`. For example:

```html 
<link href=”styles.css” rel=”stylesheet”>
```

The `href` value is the URL to the resource. The `rel` value indicates the type of link, or relationship, the resource has to the current document.

#### Link types 

Because of web standards, browsers already know how to interpret certain link types.

One common link type is `stylesheet`. When a browser loads a page that contains `<link href=”styles.css” rel=”stylesheet”>`, the browser automatically knows to import a style sheet from the given URL.

##### `monetization` link type

As a developer, the most important piece of Web Monetization is the `monetization` link type. It’s what tells the world that your HTML document supports Web Monetization.

Add the link type to your document like so:

```html
<link href=”https://wallet.example.com/alice” rel=”monetization”>
```

When adding a monetization link, the `rel` must equal `monetization`. The `href` value is the wallet address of the payment account into which payments will be received.

Importantly, the `monetization` link type is not a standard link type (yet). How, then, do web browsers know what to do? The answer is that browsers need help from a [Web Monetization agent](/docs/resources/glossary#wm-agent). 

Current state

The Web Monetization agent extends the capabilities of the HTML DOM API so that web browsers can support the `monetization` link type.

Future state (hopefully)

The `monetization` link type is accepted as a standard, making it natively supported by web browsers. The Web Monetization agent no longer has to extend the HTML DOM API.

## Monetization `<link>` element


















--------


Web Monetization (WM) extends the capabilities of the standard HTML `<link>` element to add support for `rel="monetization"`.

### Syntax

```html
<link rel="monetization" href="https://(walletaddress)">
```

* The `rel` attribute is always `monetization`
* The `href` attribute equals your wallet address

For example:

```html
<link rel="monetization" href="https://wallet.example.com/alice">
```

:::note
The `href` attribute only supports a wallet address in URL format. If your wallet address begins with `$`, visit <LinkOut href='https://paymentpointers.org/'>paymentpointers.org</LinkOut> and enter your address into the _Payment Pointer_ field. Use the address that appears in the adjacent _URL_ field as your `href` value.
:::

### How it works

<Steps>
1. Your site visitor installs a <mark>WM agent</mark>, then visits your page.
2. Their WM agent identifies your monetization `<link>` and parses the link to get your wallet address.
3. Their WM agent requests authorization and instructions from your wallet to send you a payment.
4. Their WM agent sends the authorization and instructions to the visitor's wallet.
5. The visitor's wallet initiates an outgoing payment to your wallet. 
</Steps>

#### WM agents

The `rel="monetization"` link type isn't a <LinkOut href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/dev/links.html#linkTypes">standard</LinkOut> link type. Until it becomes a standard, web browsers will require help from WM agents (for example, WM extensions) to interpret the link type and facilitate payments.

## Link placement

The `monetization` link type is `body-ok`, meaning the `<link>` element is allowed in the `<head>` and/or `<body>`.

## Multiple monetization links

A single HTML document can contain multiple monetization `<link>` elements; however, the visitor's WM agent (e.g., extension) is responsible for handling this scenario. One WM agent could choose to split payments evenly between all links while another could choose to only send payments to the first link on the page.

:::tip[Recommendation]
The Interledger WM extension splits payments evenly between links, regardless of the payment being a tip or a stream. We recommend other WM agents follow this approach.

## Monetizing media 

The following elements can be web monetized by adding the monetization `<link>` element between the open and close tags.

* `<video>`
* `<audio>`
* `<picture>`

For example:

```html
<audio src="music.mp3">
    <link rel=”monetization” href=”https://wallet.example.com/bob”>
</audio>
```

<p><mark>If the site visitor is streaming a payment, then… (does the media element have to be active/playing?)</mark></p>

<p><mark>If the site visitor tips, then… (will the wallet defined for media receive a tip if it's not active/playing?)</mark></p>
