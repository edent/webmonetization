This page provides basic instructions for web monetizing a page with a single monetization link. For more information about how you can use monetization links, visit the [Monetization link element](/docs/implement/link) page.

## Prerequisites

- You must have a wallet address assigned to you by your [wallet provider](/docs/wallet-address/wallets). Check out our [FAQ](/docs/wallet-address/wallet-faq) for more information about wallet addresses. 
- Your page must be secure and served over HTTPS.

## Web monetize your page

<Steps>

1. Get your wallet address. For example:
    ```http
    https://wallet.example.com/alice
    ```
    :::note[$wallet.example/alice]
    If your wallet address begins with `$`, visit <LinkOut href='https://paymentpointers.org/'>paymentpointers.org</LinkOut> and enter your address into the _Payment Pointer_ field. Use the address that appears in the adjacent _URL_ field as your wallet address.
    :::
2. Copy the code block below and replace the `href` value with your wallet address.
    ```http
    <link rel="monetization" href="https://wallet.example.com/alice">
    ```
3. Add the `<link>` to the `<head>` section of your page.
    ```html title="Example"
    <html>
      <head>
        <title>My Site</title>
        <link rel="monetization" href="https://wallet.example.com/alice">
      </head>
    </html>
    ```
</Steps>

Congratulations! Your page is now web monetized.
