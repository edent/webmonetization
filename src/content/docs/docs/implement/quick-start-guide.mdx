This page provides basic instructions for adding a Web Monetization (WM) `<link>` element to a web page.

## Prerequisites

- Web monetized pages must be secure and served over HTTPS.
- You must have the wallet address assigned to you by your [wallet provider](/docs/wallet/wallets).

## Monetize a page

<Steps>

1. Decide whether to add the `<link>` element to the `<head>` or `<body>` of your page.

    :::note
    * Head - 
    * Body - 
    :::

2. Format the `<link>` element as shown below. The `rel` value is always `monetization`. The `href` value is your wallet address.

    ```html title="Example link in head"
    <html>
      <head>
        <title>My Site</title>
        <link rel="monetization" href="https://wallet.example.com/alice">
      </head>
    </html>
    ```

    :::note[$wallet.example/alice]
    If your wallet address begins with `$`, visit <LinkOut href='https://paymentpointers.org/'>paymentpointers.org</LinkOut> and enter your address into the _Payment Pointer_ field. Use the address that appears in the adjacent _URL_ field as your `href` value.
