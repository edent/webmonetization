title: onmonetization event handler
---

import { LinkOut } from "@interledger/docs-design-system";

The `onmonetization` attribute of the `GlobalEventHandlers` mixin is used to process `monetization` events sent to the `window` object. 

`onmonetization` can be applied to any element and is used by the user agent, such as a web browser, to notify that some `<link>` element is [monetized](/docs/implement/link).

In a tabbed browser, each tab is represented by its own `window` object.

## Syntax

```js
window.onmonetization = functionRef
```

<p><mark>Check the following statement.</mark></p>

`functionRef` is a reference to a function that will execute when a `monetization` event is sent to the `window`.

## Example

Show a visitor an alert box and message when a [Web Monetization event](/docs/implement/events) fires.

```js
window.onmonetization = function () {
  alert('This page supports Web Monetization.')
}
```
