The `onmonetization` attribute of the `GlobalEventHandlers` mixin is used to process `monetization` events sent to the `Window`.

`onmonetization` can be applied to any element and is used by the <mark>user agent</mark> to notify that some `<link>` element is monetized.

## Syntax

```js
window.onmonetization = functionRef
```

## Example

Show a visitor an alert box and message when a Web Monetization event is triggered.

```js
window.onmonetization = function () {
  alert('This page supports Web Monetization.')
}
```
