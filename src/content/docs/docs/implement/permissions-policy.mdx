title: Permissions Policy
---

A Permissions Policy provides mechanisms for web developers to explicitly declare what functionality can and cannot be used on a website. The `monetization` directive allows you to control whether the current document and any nesting browsing contexts (iframes) are allowed to use the Web Monetization API.

## Enable and configure your Policy

To enable Permissions Policy, you must configure your web server to return the `Permissions-Policy` HTTP header.

Configuring `Permissions-Policy` involves adding the header to each applicable web page and giving the header a list of origins permitted to use the Web Monetization API.

### Syntax

The basic syntax is as follows, where `allowlist` is a list of origins permitted to use the Web Monetization API.

```html
Permissions-Policy: monetization=(allowlist)
```

`<allowlist>` can be any one of the values listed in the MDN Web Docs Permissions-Policy page.
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Permissions-Policy#syntax 

## Example

You want to permit the parent page and all iframes within the page to use the Web Monetization API.

```html
Permissions-Policy: monetization=(self)
```

`self` is the default policy for `monetization`.

:::note
The `allowlist` attribute only takes effect when the `content navigable` of the iframe is navigated. Adding or removing the `monetization` attribute has no effect on an already-loaded document.
