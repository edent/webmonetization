The Web Monetization API is made up of the `MonetizationEvent` and `MonetizationCurrencyAmount` interfaces. These interfaces expose the Web Monetization API and allow you to retrieve basic payment information.

## `MonetizationEvent` interface

`MonetizationEvent` DOM events provide information about sent payments. 

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>`Event.bubbles`</td>
      <td>Yes</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>`Event.cancelable`</td>
      <td>No</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Event handler</td>
      <td>[`onmonetization`](/docs/implement/onmonetization)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

By listening for `monetization` events, you can use the information returned by the attributes below to find out basic payment details.

* `amountSent` - The amount sent, not received. The `MonetizationCurrencyAmount` constructs the value for this attribute.
* `incomingPayment` - A URL representing an incoming payment that can be used to determine the amount received. 
* `paymentPointer` - A URL representing the wallet address that an incoming payment request was sent to.

Visit the [Monetization Events](/docs/implement/events) page for more information.

## `MonetizationCurrencyAmount` interface

The members within `MonetizationCurrencyAmount` are used to construct the `MonetizationEvent` interface's `amountSent`.

* `currency` - An <LinkOut href="https://www.iban.com/currency-codes">ISO4217</LinkOut> well-formed 3-letter alphabetic code.
* `value` - A <LinkOut href="https://www.w3.org/TR/payment-request/#dfn-valid-decimal-monetary-value">valid decimal monetary value</LinkOut> containing a monetary amount.

The members of this interface map directly to the Payment Request API's <LinkOut href="https://www.w3.org/TR/payment-request/#dom-paymentcurrencyamount">`PaymentCurrencyAmount`</LinkOut> dictionary.
