## A

<hr />

### Account servicing entity (ASE)

<ASE />

:::note[Usage note]
The terms *wallet provider* and *digital wallet provider* are frequently used throughout the documentation to mean any type of ASE that has implemented Open Payments.

## O

<hr />

### Open Payments (OP)

<LinkOut href="https://openpayments.dev/">Open Payments</LinkOut> is a specification and set of APIs that define standards for access to digital payment accounts.

When an [ASE](#account-servicing-entity-ase) implements Open Payments on its customers' accounts, third-party applications and other entities can initiate payments from their users’ payment accounts (with permission).

Open Payments-enabled accounts are assigned one or more [wallet addresses](#wallet-address). Wallet addresses are a required component of Web Monetization.

## P

<hr />

### Payment pointer

A payment pointer is a type of [wallet address](#wallet-address) that's assigned to payment accounts that use Interledger as the underlying payment method. For example, `$wallet.example.com/alice`. 

All payment pointers resolve to an HTTPS URL. Because the `href` value in a monetization `<link>` must be a URL, you must convert a payment pointer to its URL equivalent. Enter your payment pointer into the field provided on <LinkOut href="https://paymentpointers.org/">paymentpointers.org</LinkOut> to get the URL.

## U

<hr />

### User agent

A <LinkOut href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/User_agent">user agent</LinkOut> is a computer program representing or acting on behalf of a person. A web browser is a common example of a user agent. 

## W

### Web Monetization (WM)

#### WM agent

The WM agent is a type of software agent. A <LinkOut href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_agent">software agent</LinkOut> is a program that has the authority to act on behalf of a user or another program. The WM agent is the backend software that acts on behalf of both a web monetized site visitor and a web monetized page.

The purpose of the WM agent is to recognize when a page is web monetized and automatically carry out certain Web Monetization tasks. These tasks include:

* Extending the HTML DOM API so that `monetization` is a valid [link type](/docs/implement/link)
* Processing multiple monetization links in an HTML document, when applicable
* Instrumenting payments by calling the Open Payments API<br /><mark>need link to relevant page/section</mark>
* Firing [`monetization`](/docs/implement/events) events after an outgoing payment is created 
* Processing `monetization` events sent to the browser window via the [`onmonetization`](/docs/implement/onmonetization) event handler
* Enabling the CSP [`monetization-src`](/docs/implement/csp) and Permissions Policy [`monetization`](/docs/implement/permissions-policy) directives

Until the WM agent is natively included in web browsers, the agent must be added to browsers some other way. One way is to install an extension that includes the agent, such as the Interledger Foundation's WM extension.

#### WM configuration software 

The software that:

* Provides site visitors with a UI to enable and configure Web Monetization in their browsers
* Passes the configuration on to the [WM agent](#wm-agent)

Examples of WM software include extensions and built-in browser configuration pages. 

The features and functionalities of WM software can vary. For example, the Interledger Foundation’s WM extension allows users to enter their own wallet address, set up a budget, and establish payment rates. Another extension may have more or less capabilities, depending on the extension provider's business model.

#### WM service provider 

An entity that has:

* Full control over an [Open Payments](#open-payments-op)-enabled account and associated [wallet address(es)](#wallet-address) 
* The ability to grant authorization for WM payments to be sent from the account

If you, as an individual, meet the criteria above, then you are acting as your own WM service provider. 

It may be impossible to obtain an Open Payments-enabled account in some jurisdictions. If you're unable to obtain your own account for this or any other reason, you may be able to sign up with a third-party WM service provider. 

A third-party WM service provider is an entity that meets the above criteria and with whom you enter into a service agreement. In return, the service provider authorizes you to send Web Monetization payments from their account. The service provider retains full control over their account and can grant/revoke your authorization at any time.
